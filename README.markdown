# Serbian QWERTZ and QWERTY keyboard layouts for macOS

The keyboard layout for the Serbian language that's used in the Mac OS is different than the standard one which makes using macOS a PITA for the people like me that are used to the standard layout. Since Bosnian, Croatian and Slovene (according to [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Bosnian.2C_Croatian_and_Slovene)) are using the same layout, they too can benefit from this.

## Installation and usage

1. Copy the 
  * `Serbian QWERTZ.keylayout` and `Serbian QWERTZ.icns` 

    or

  * `Serbian QWERTY.keylayout` and `Serbian QWERTY.icns`

files to your `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` directory.

2. Enable the layout in the `System Preferences/Language & Text/Input Sources` dialog.
